# 🚂 Railway Deployment Guide

## 🎯 Why Railway is Perfect for Your ML Project

✅ **500 hours/month FREE** (vs Heroku's limited free tier)  
✅ **No credit card required** for free tier  
✅ **Full ML environment** (scikit-learn, pandas, numpy)  
✅ **No cold starts** - your app stays warm  
✅ **Automatic deployments** from GitHub  
✅ **Built-in monitoring** and logs  
✅ **Easy scaling** when you need it  

## 🚀 Quick Railway Deployment (5 minutes)

### Step 1: Prepare Project
Your project is already Railway-ready with:
- ✅ `Procfile` configured
- ✅ `requirements.txt` with ML dependencies
- ✅ `runtime.txt` for Python version

### Step 2: Deploy to Railway

1. **Go to Railway**: https://railway.app/
2. **Sign up/Login** with GitHub
3. **New Project** → **Deploy from GitHub repo**
4. **Select** `coderheist/Student_dropout_rate`
5. **Deploy** → Railway auto-detects Flask and deploys!

### Step 3: Configure (Optional)
```bash
# Railway automatically reads your Procfile:
web: gunicorn --chdir backend --bind 0.0.0.0:$PORT app:app
```

## 📡 Railway Deployment Process

1. **Auto-Detection**: Railway reads `requirements.txt` and `Procfile`
2. **Build**: Installs all ML dependencies (Flask, scikit-learn, pandas)
3. **Deploy**: Starts your Flask app with gunicorn
4. **Live**: Your app is available at `your-app.railway.app`

## 🎨 Railway Dashboard Features

- **Metrics**: CPU, memory, and request monitoring
- **Environment Variables**: Easy configuration management
- **Custom Domains**: Add your own domain (free)
- **Auto-Redeploy**: Updates on every GitHub push

## 💰 Railway Pricing (Very Generous)

### Free Tier:
- **500 execution hours/month** (vs Heroku's 550)
- **1 GB RAM** per service
- **1 GB disk** storage
- **Unlimited projects**
- **No sleep mode** (stays active)

### Paid Tier ($5/month):
- **Unlimited execution hours**
- **Higher resource limits**
- **Priority support**

## 🔧 Alternative Deployment Methods

### Method 1: Railway CLI
```bash
# Install Railway CLI
npm install -g @railway/cli

# Login and deploy
railway login
railway link
railway up
```

### Method 2: Direct Git Integration (Recommended)
1. Connect GitHub repository in Railway dashboard
2. Enable auto-deployments
3. Push code → Automatic deployment

## 📊 Expected Performance

- **Build Time**: ~2-3 minutes (installs ML dependencies)
- **Cold Start**: None (Railway keeps apps warm)
- **Response Time**: ~100-200ms after first load
- **Model Loading**: ~10-15 seconds on first request
- **Concurrent Users**: Handles 100+ concurrent users on free tier

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

**Build Failed**:
- Check `requirements.txt` format
- Ensure all dependencies are compatible
- View build logs in Railway dashboard

**App Not Starting**:
- Verify `Procfile` syntax
- Check Python version in `runtime.txt`
- Review application logs

**Model Loading Issues**:
- Ensure `random_forest_model.pkl` is in repository
- Check file paths in `backend/app.py`
- Verify model file size (Railway supports up to 1GB)

## 🎯 Post-Deployment

### Your Live URLs:
- **Main App**: `https://your-app.railway.app/`
- **API Health**: `https://your-app.railway.app/`
- **Predictions**: `https://your-app.railway.app/predict`
- **Complete Form**: `https://your-app.railway.app/frontend-simple/`

### Testing Your Deployment:
```bash
# Health check
curl https://your-app.railway.app/

# Make a prediction
curl -X POST https://your-app.railway.app/predict \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"Application_order": 1, "Course": 33, "Admission_grade": 150}'
```
